     * You cannot set a priority on an empty location. For this reason

     *
     * Children with no priority come first.
     * Children with a number as their priority come next. They are sorted numerically by priority (small to large).
     * Children with a string as their priority come last. They are sorted lexicographically by priority.
     * Whenever two children have the same priority (including no priority), they are sorted by key. Numeric
     * keys come first (sorted numerically), followed by the remaining keys (sorted lexicographically).
     *
     * Note that priorities are parsed and ordered as IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point numbers.
     * Keys are always stored as strings and are treated as numbers only when they can be parsed as a
     * 32-bit integer
